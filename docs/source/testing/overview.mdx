Apollo Kotlin provides the following tools to assist in testing your code:

- [`MockServer`](./mocking-http-responses): an HTTP server that you can use to mock any responses
- [`TestNetworkTransport`](./mocking-graphql-responses): enables you to specify the GraphQL responses returned
  by `ApolloClient`
- [Test builders](./test-builders): help instantiate your model classes by providing an DSL
- An [`IdlingResource`](./ui-tests) that you can use in your Espresso UI Tests

`MockServer` creates a full HTTP server. It will require very little changes to your production code as you'll only need
to change `serverUrl`, meaning the same ApolloClient can be used for tests and production. It is also useful for testing
specific server behaviors, such as error cases, HTTP headers, and timeouts.

`TestNetworkTransport` bypasses HTTP calls altogether and returns preregistered GraphQL responses. It is more
lightweight and requires more modifications to your production code. You can use it in lighter tests that don't need to
create a server. Test builders can be used to instantiate the data in the responses.
